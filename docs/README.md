# wvu-purchases

**NOTE**: This is currently a work in progress.

This project provides a SQLite(3) database of purchase records from [West Virginia University](https://wvu.edu), and a simple command-line tool to help manage record ingestion from the various formats (in Excel) used by the [Office of Procurement Contracting & Payment Services](https://procurement.wvu.edu/).

### Data

All information has been sourced from WVU over the course of many years via WVFOIA (W.Va. Code ยง 29B-1-1), and the intent is to keep the database updated on a rolling fiscal year basis as the University releases information.

Current data spans from **Jan 26, 2017** to **Dec 2, 2021**.
